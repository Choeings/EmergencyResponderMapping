# EmergencyResponderMapping

For problems with emergency vehicle traversal and terrain mapping, the offered Java programme gives a flexible solution. It makes it possible to read topographic maps from CSV files, simulate rainfall and flooding, and determine whether or not emergency vehicles can reach certain sites without running into impassable water bodies. This code has practical applications in the building of infrastructure, disaster management, topographic mapping, and emergency response planning. It also improves public safety by providing effective access routes for emergency vehicles. This adaptable programme is crucial in real-world settings when geography, weather, and efficient emergency response come together, eventually helping to save lives and minimise property damage.
